# React + Vite

## Day Two:

using yesterday's Vite app (ie - make sure you start with THAT code) - even if it's just COPY/PASTE

BUTTCHUG - 
    get through useState ASAP - hardcoding = BAD.
    we don't want SOME options - we need ALL the options!! 
    why use useState?  
        updatable - manages the page - without needing to refresh!! 
        how cool!!!

    two new states - one for 
    
    cover .map AND .forEach

    also - we don't always get what we want
    how long does it take to get a book back from some library API (Application Programming Interface)

HOW LONG? -> Introduce two books
    "War and Peace" by Leo Tolstoy contains 587,287 words and 1,225 pages
    "Goodnight Moon" by Margaret Wise Brown has 30 pages and 130 words
        20 instances of the word "Goodnight"

talk about fetch - fetch is BUILT IN Chrome

ASYNC JS
    Event Loop
        Computer Science & Data Structure Concepts
        STACK - QUEUE - HEAP
    Walk through simple examples
        things logging out in order

How Many pokemon ARE THERE???
    Retrieving 150 pokemon for the dropdown box

    THEN fetch in React - ie: 


ON THE LINE FOR PART 2
    implement useEffect 
    
GETTING ALL 100 pokemon to render in the drop down!!

DEF Part 2: Reactify the user experience.
    convert click event to onChange. and render an image
    



fully part 2:
    useEffect fully implemented - 150 pokemon
    THEN
    improving user interaction
    WHY HAVE a click?
    onChangeEvent
        more dynamic 


## Day One Covered:

Create React App using Vite
`npm create vite`

Start the application
`npm run dev`

update the `src/App.jsx` with the App
update the `src/App.css` 
REMOVE index.css content

rewrite the JavaScript code INTO the App.jsx -> ie: use JS INSIDE JSX
